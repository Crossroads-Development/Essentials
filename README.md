IF SUBMITTING TRANSLATIONS:

The guidebook files are stored in Essentials/src/main/resources/python/docs/src/ as txt files.
Edit those files, NOT the book JSON files. The JSON files are auto-generated based on the txt files. 
For full details on the formatting for the txt files (probably more information than you need), see the top of https://github.com/Crossroads-Development/Essentials/blob/1.18/src/main/resources/python/docs/GenDocs.py.
