Shift-right-clicking with the <item>Circuit Wrench/$ opens a menu to choose which circuit to place, and which describes each circuit type. Shift-right clicking with a <item>Circuit Wrench/$ on a circuit will rotate that circuit instead (normal <item>$(l:essentials/wrench)wrenches/$ can still rotate circuits). Example circuits are <item>AND/$, <item>XOR/$, and <item>Multiplication/$, which do what the names suggest.\n\n"

Each <item>Circuit/$ other than <item>Wire Plate/$ and <item>Wire Splice Plate/$ has a two tick delay (1 redstone tick).\n\nWhile holding a <item>Circuit Wrench/$, all nearby <item>Circuits/$ will display their output signal strength over them. When multiple circuits are outputting on the same <item>Wire Plate/$, the output value <em>farthest from zero/$ will be used (3 wins over 2, -3 wins over 2, 3 wins over -3).\n\n<item>Circuits/$ can be divided into a few categories:\n\n"
