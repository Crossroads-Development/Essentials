The <item>Slotted Chest/$ is a one block chest the size of a double chest, and it has a very interesting quirk.
When removing an item from a slot, it leaves a ghost item behind. You can shift click into the <item>Slotted Chest/$, but only if the slot the items are going to already has the matching item. To clear a ghost item, shift click it with an empty cursor.
Also, automation will respect the ghost items, will only be able to insert into a slot if it already has a match and when extracting items it always leaves a ghost item behind. This lets you format your storage chests without fear of shift clicks or automation messing it up.
