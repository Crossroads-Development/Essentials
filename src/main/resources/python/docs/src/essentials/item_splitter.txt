Has two versions: Basic and Redstone.
Has two item outputs and can accept items from any non-output side. Cleanly splits inserted items out the two outputs by the set ratio.
The <item>Basic Item Splitter/$ has the ratio set by shift right clicking with a <item>Wrench/$ (options are 0/12, 1/12, 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 5/12, 1/2, 7/12, 3/4, 2/3, 5/6, 12/12), while the <item>Redstone Item Splitter/$ has the ratio equal to (redstone input)/15.
A compact way to divide items between two outputs.
